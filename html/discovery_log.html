                    this entailed a large majority of the session being dedicated to introductions between
                    lectures and fellow peers, it also allowed the class to be informed of any introductory
                    projects we are going to have. Introductory segments were allocated to the overview of the
                    unit, breaking down each module to a few areas:</p>

                paid for and provided the details for each student to own a domain on Google’s cloud servers,
                we have access to a personal virtual environment to perform task that may aid our work. To which,

                    locate websites as part of a questionnaire, we had to find “horrific” websites
                    such as: <span class="week_2_span">www.lingscars.com</span> or <span class="week_2_span">www.hosanna1.com.</span>
                    Other questions related to similar areas; however, differed to examples such
                    as: websites that I favored or disliked, the second part of this task was to

                    people to complete a Google Doc based on Web Security, we had five sections
                    to input data, mainly opinions, the subject headers were:</p>

                    <p class="week_3_p">We had to list several ways of how information is created regarding oneself on mediums
                    like social media. We concluded how much personal data people upload on a daily
                    basis, this can be shocking because of how much information third party people can gather.
                    This can be, geolocation via sign in and photos to learn personal patters and whereabouts,
                    possibility of leading to criminal actions. To end the lesson, we had one class Doc as a public
                    preference for the entirety of information to be shared to compare and evaluate student answers.</p>

                    is… HTML, as I mentioned in week two, my Uni has given us VM's, today we got to upload a simple HTML
                    document to the server and have our very own webspace. This wasn't anything new for me, so…
                    I messed around trying to open port 21 of the server to allow for FTP uploads. Screw editing
                    web docs in a terminal, unless SpaceMacs is install. Idea…</p>

                    Matt had to re-inform me of how to code a for loop; I did learn the difference between (JS keyword)
